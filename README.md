# noughts_and_crosses_nds

A tiny Noughts & Crosses game for the Nintendo DS.

This is very WIP and probably will never be finished. Its destiny is probably just to serve as another code example that people can possibly use for reference in future.

Some notes:

- The game uses a single screen (the main screen) and touch controls.
- The graphics are drawn using the sprite/OAM API https://libnds.devkitpro.org/sprite_8h.html. Each "cell" in the game is a 32x32 image.
